Create table "pidgin_words" in database with 3 fields:

"id" - int, primary key, auto-increment, 
"word" - varchar (255), 
"explanation" - text

Create 2 pages:
1. List of pidgin words
2. When user click the link from list of words he goes to page with detailed explanation of this word

----------------------------------------------------

Create table "users" in database with fields:

"id" - int, primary key, auto-increment, 
"name" - varchar (255), 
"password" - varchar (255), 
"email" - varchar (255)

Write a code of page signup containing the form with 3 text input fields: Name, Password and Email and button "Sign up". 
When user click on the button values from the form should be inserted into database table "users".

HINT!!! For this you need to use SQL query and put values from users input into this:

$sql = "INSERT INTO songs VALUES ( 4, '".$_POST["name"]."', 'Zlatan', 'wwtrrtertert')";

------------------------------------------------------

Create table "products" in database with fields:

"id" - int, primary key, auto-increment, 
"name" - varchar (255), 
"description" - varchar (255)

Make a new page /products/index.php and add link "Products" to menu for it. 
When user click on this link he sees  the list of products similar to list of pidgin words. 
Next to every product you need to add button "Buy". If logged user press the button you need to add product name to the \
session variable $_SESSION["user"]["products"] which is list (indexed array) of product names.

HINT! PHP code for adding products will be smth like:

$_SESSION["user"]["products"][] = $_POST["name"];

HINT! HTML code for list of products shoud be like:

<?php foreach($products as $product): ?>

<form><?=$product["name"]?><input type="submit" name="buy" value="Buy">
<input type="hidden" name="name" value="<?=$product["name"]?>"> 
</form><br><br>

<?php endforeach; ?>

Then make a page /users/basket.php and add link "Basket" to menu for it. When logged user click on it he will see list 
of selected products. You need to print it out from $_SESSION["user"]["products"] array.

-------------------------

Add new column to table "products":@@

"price" - decimal(10,2) with default value NULL@@

Then update all records in table with price values@@

Add price information to pages "Products" and "Basket". Products should be displayed in form of table on these pages 
with following columns:@@

First column should contain product name and on next line description with small letters.@@

Second column should contain price with dollar sign.@@

Third columns should contain quantity. On "Products" page it should be input field. 
On "Basket" page it should be just text. @@

Forth column should contain for "Products" page - button "Add to basket". 
For "Basket" page - total ammount to pay for this product ( price * qty ). @@

The last row of table on page "Basket" should contain total ammount to pay for all products.
